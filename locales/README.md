# ZenOS Locales

This folder contains gettext `.po` files for ZenOS plugin labels.

The `en.po` file is the source catalog. All other locale files
are translated from it. Strings with an empty `msgstr ""` fall back to English
at runtime — KOReader handles this automatically.

## Contributing

To improve or correct a translation, edit the appropriate `.po` file and open a
pull request. Strings are grouped alphabetically by `msgid`. Leave `msgstr ""`
blank for any string you are not confident about — KOReader will fall back to
the English source string.

## Maintenance

Put the Cloud Translation key in the ignored project `.env` file:

```dotenv
GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY=your-cloud-translation-api-key
```

Then synchronize every catalog with the Lua source:

```sh
python3 translation_utils.py --sync
```

This removes dead entries, adds missing entries, translates empty `msgstr`
values, and alphabetizes each catalog. Untranslated English strings are sent to
Google Cloud Translation Basic; existing translations are preserved. Enable the
Cloud Translation API for the key first. Use `--locale LOCALE`
to process only one catalog. Generated entries include nearby Lua context and
`filename.lua:line` references for translators.

The project `.env` file is ignored by Git. An exported
`GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY` takes precedence when both are present.
