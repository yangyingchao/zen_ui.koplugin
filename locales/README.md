# ZenOS Locales

This folder contains gettext `.po` files for ZenOS plugin labels.

The `en.po` file is the source catalog. All other locale files
are translated from it. Strings with an empty `msgstr ""` fall back to English
at runtime — KOReader handles this automatically.

## Translations

| Locale | Language |

## Contributing

To improve or correct a translation, edit the appropriate `.po` file and open a
pull request. Strings are grouped alphabetically by `msgid`. Leave `msgstr ""`
blank for any string you are not confident about — KOReader will fall back to
the English source string.

## Maintenance

Synchronize every catalog with the Lua source in one command:

```sh
python3 translation_utils.py --sync
```

This removes dead entries, adds missing entries, translates empty `msgstr`
values, and alphabetizes each catalog. Untranslated English strings are sent to
Google Translate; existing translations are preserved. Use `--locale LOCALE`
to process only one catalog.
