# Zen UI tests

Run all commands from the plugin root through `./spec/run`.

- `lua` runs Busted specs with KOReader's LuaJIT and a fresh `KO_HOME`.
- `smoke` runs the deterministic Python smoke contract against the stable runtime.
- `full` runs Lua, smoke, visual golden checks, and package validation.
- `nightly-smoke` repeats the smoke contract against the latest KOReader master runtime.
- `update-goldens` is the only command allowed to replace committed PNG baselines.
- `package-check` builds the plugin and asserts that test assets are absent.

Set `KOREADER_DIR` to an emulator runtime directory containing `luajit`,
`frontend`, `spec/rocks`, and bundled plugins such as CoverBrowser. Emulator
runs stage those bundled plugins alongside Zen UI and the test driver. The
runner never uses a system Lua interpreter for behavior tests and creates a
temporary `KO_HOME` for every invocation.

Runtime versions live in `koreader-lock.json`. Update a pin deliberately, then
regenerate the affected goldens and review every PNG diff. Test artifacts belong
under `spec/.artifacts/` and are ignored by Git.

`runtime-modules.txt` is the explicit production-module inventory. Add every
new runtime Lua file there with its intended test layer before merging it.
The runtime manifest guards against silently omitting unloaded UI and
integration modules from the test plan.

Set `ZEN_UI_PYTEST_TARGET` to one Python test file when debugging a single
emulator scenario; normal smoke and CI runs still execute the complete suite.

## Linux goldens

The committed framebuffer baselines are generated only on Linux/Xvfb at
800×600. Run the `Generate Linux Goldens` workflow manually, download its
`linux-goldens` artifact, review the PNGs, and commit the approved files under
`spec/goldens/v2026.07/linux-800x600/`. Normal CI only compares committed
baselines; it never writes or pushes goldens. A missing Linux baseline is a
test failure, so the initial artifact must be reviewed and committed before
the regular CI job can pass.
