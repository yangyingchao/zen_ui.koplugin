## Overview

Build a personal Home page from date and time, featured book, reading stats, reading goals, book strip, and quotes widgets. The layout uses a responsive capacity grid so it can make better use of taller or wider screens while keeping widget proportions predictable. Use a built-in preset or save your own layout.

## Options

- Show and arrange any combination of the six built-in widgets that fits the screen's capacity. At least one widget remains enabled.
- Use Edit mode to open widget settings directly from Home.
- Apply, save, rename, and delete home page presets.
- Show or hide the home page top status bar.
- Configure automatic or manual font sizing for date/time, stats, and quotes.
- Set Featured content to Recently read, To Be Read, or one custom book.
- Set Strip content to a library source, specific tag, folder, or up to 40 custom books.
- Add up to seven Strip control tabs for library sources, tags, folders, actions, Controls, plugin menus, or KOReader menus.
- Configure text styles, progress labels, interactivity, filters, and widget-specific display options.
- Track daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly reading goals using pages, time, or supported book-count targets.
- Use stable page labels in featured-widget progress when a book provides a page map.

## Stable Page Labels

Home featured widgets use KOReader page-map data when it is available. That means progress labels can show the same stable page labels used in the reader, page browser, and table of contents instead of only calculated file pages.

## Custom quotes

Add personal quotes by editing `settings/ZenOS/quotes.lua`, then enable **Custom quotes** under **Zen Settings > Home > Widgets > Quotes > Quote sources**. Custom quotes can be combined with the default list and annotations. Each entry can be a `{ text, author, title }` table, the older `{ text, author }` form, or a plain string without attribution.

```lua
return {
    -- Existing formats remain supported:
    -- { text = "Quote text", author = "Author" },
    -- "Plain quote without author",

    -- The title field is optional:
    -- { text = "Quote text", author = "Author", title = "Book title" },
}
```

Annotation quotes are collected from books in KOReader's reading history and
book-information cache. Tap an annotation quote to open its book at the saved
location. Swipe horizontally on the widget to move between quotes. Quotes use a
persistent shuffled deck, so every enabled quote is shown before the list is
reshuffled.
