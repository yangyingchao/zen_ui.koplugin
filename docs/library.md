## Overview

Library settings control how books and folders appear and how you browse them. They cover display layouts, sorting, covers, the status bar, home folders, book details, and metadata tools.

## Options

- Configure the top status bar with left, center, and right item slots.
- Choose display mode, mosaic density, list density, item underlines, and list borders.
- Configure folder covers, folder labels, hidden up-folder rows, and automatic series grouping.
- Optionally flatten subfolders into one library view without changing files on disk.
- Configure cover badges, progress indicators, uniform cover ratios, rounded corners, title and author text, and finished-book dimming.
- Configure the scroll bar as a bar, dots, or page number.
- Set and lock the home folder, add extra home folders, and control delete access.
- Edit book metadata and covers manually or fill them from online providers.
- Choose and arrange the information shown on Book details pages.
- Optionally include new and updated books in To Be Read views.

## To Be Read

To add a book to To Be Read, hold it in the Library and choose **Read status > To Be Read**. It then appears in To Be Read Navbar tabs and Home widgets that use that source. **Include new books in TBR** also includes unread or modified books without changing their saved read status.

## Metadata editor

![Metadata editor](/images/zen_os/metadata_editor.webp)

Open **Edit > Edit metadata** from a book's context menu, or choose **Edit** on a ZenOS Book details page. The editor can change the filename, cover, title, authors, series and position, genres, language, publisher, and description. Close a book before editing its metadata.

**Find metadata** searches every enabled provider and can use the book's ISBN or a title and author query. Hardcover and Google Books require credentials; enter them under **Zen Settings > Library > Metadata**. They are stored locally as plain text and never logged. Open Library requires no credential. Search results show available editions with their format, publisher, language, page count, and cover so you can choose the correct match.

### Metadata provider credentials

The easiest setup is through **Zen Settings > Library > Metadata**:

1. **Hardcover:** Sign in to [Hardcover's API page](https://hardcover.app/account/api), create a personal access token with only the `read:catalog` permission, and copy the token value. Open **Hardcover > Hardcover API token** in ZenOS and paste it without a leading `Bearer ` prefix. The same Hardcover submenu can display this page as a QR code.
2. **Google Books:** In Google Cloud, select or create a project, [enable the Books API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/books.googleapis.com), then open [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and choose **Create credentials > API key**. Restrict the key to the **Books API**, copy it, and paste it under **Google Books > Google Books API key**. See [Google's API-key instructions](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using#acquiring_and_using_an_api_key) for more detail.

To install the credentials manually instead, put each raw value on one line in the following file:

| Credential | File |
| --- | --- |
| Hardcover token | `koreader/settings/ZenOS/hardcover_token.txt` |
| Google Books API key | `koreader/settings/ZenOS/google_books_api_key.txt` |

Use the exact filenames above. Do not add a variable name, quotes, or `Bearer `; these files contain only the credential. Keep them private and out of shared backups.

For EPUB files, ZenOS writes supported metadata into the book after confirmation. Enable **Keep an EPUB metadata backup** if you want a **Restore** action; the editor keeps one backup beside the EPUB. Other formats, including PDF, keep the original document unchanged and save KOReader metadata overrides in the book's sidecar data. Cover changes use KOReader's custom-cover file.

## Custom folder covers

Long-press a folder and open **Edit > Set folder cover** to see a full-screen vertical mosaic of cover slots and their current previews. Each row places the preview on the left, **Cover N** vertically centered, and a Zen **Clear** button at the far right. Tap a cover or press OK/Enter on its focused row to choose an image; press and hold it or tap **Clear** to remove the reference. Single-cover mode offers one slot; gallery and stack modes show all four slots together on one page without pagination. Previews scale to fit the page while using the same aspect ratio, crop mode, and rounded-corner styling as the Library file picker. A gallery or stack with only one chosen or automatic cover is displayed as one full-size cover, and chosen covers are not filled out with automatic book covers.

ZenOS stores only a reference to each chosen image: it does not copy the image into the folder or modify the source file, so the source must remain available at the selected location. Folder covers accept case-insensitive `.jpg` and `.jpeg` files. You can also manage them manually as `cover.jpg`, `cover.jpeg`, `cover1.jpg`, `cover1.jpeg`, and the equivalent names through `cover4`; these managed images stay hidden in the Library file list and override covers generated from the folder's contents. PNG, WebP, GIF, and other formats are not treated as folder covers and remain visible.

## Context menu

Tap and hold any book, folder, or the current folder in the Library/Navbar. This opens the context menu. It collects details, file management, read status, sorting, filtering, and display actions for the selected item. Available actions depend on what you held — a book, a folder, or empty space in the current folder.

![Context menu](/images/zen_os/context_menu.webp)

## Display mode & sorting
Tap + Hold on the Navbar (or any empty space) to open the context menu for the folder you are viewing (including your libraries Home folder). From here you can change the folder's display mode, sorting, and status filter on the fly. Each folder remembers its own display and sorting preferences independently, so you can browse one folder as a mosaic sorted by title and another as a detailed list sorted by recently read, and each keeps its settings across sessions.

## Filesystem
To navigate the complete filesystem, set **Zen Settings > Library > Home folder > Lock home folder** to **Off**.
