- Arrange Book details, Book switcher, and Buttons pages.
- Show launcher button labels. This is enabled by default.
- Hide reader action buttons when the launcher is shown from the library.
- Arrange launcher buttons.
- Add action buttons backed by dispatcher actions.
- Add buttons that run a chosen Controls control.
- Add plugin buttons from launchable plugin menus found on the device.
- Add context-aware KOReader submenu buttons, such as Network, Tools, or Style tweaks.
- Add folders and arrange buttons inside each folder.
- Insert a row break to start later buttons on a new row.
- Configure each button or folder label and icon.
- Move Control, action, plugin-menu, and KOReader-menu buttons into folders or back to the root launcher.
