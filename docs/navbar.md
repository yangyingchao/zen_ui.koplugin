## Overview

The Navbar adds a bottom navigation bar to the library. Tabs can open library views, folders, plugin integrations, page controls, menu actions, custom dispatcher actions, launchable plugin menus, or native KOReader submenus.

Navbar settings live under **Zen Settings > Navbar**.

## Options

- Show and arrange up to 7 visible tabs.
- Hide or show icons.
- Add custom tabs with dispatcher actions, controls, plugin menus, native KOReader submenus, icons, and labels.
- Select the destination used at startup and by the physical Home button.
- Configure Library, Folder, Home, Manga, and News tab labels or actions.
- Control active-tab styling, top border, label size, and icon size.

## Manga And News Tabs

The Manga and News tabs are flexible launchers. Each one can open a dedicated plugin or jump straight to a folder of your choice.

- **Manga tab** opens [Rakuyomi](https://github.com/tachibana-shin/rakuyomi), another manga reader, or a folder. Set the destination with **Manga tab action**, and use **Manga folder presets** to pin it to the home folder, the last folder, or the current folder.
- **News tab** opens QuickRSS, KOReader's built-in RSS Reader, or a folder. Set the destination with **News tab action**, and use **News folder presets** for the same home, last, or current folder shortcuts.

Folder mode makes either tab a one-tap shortcut to wherever you keep that content, even if you do not use the associated plugin.

## Folder And Tag Tabs

The built-in **Folder** tab opens a folder you choose. Its presets can point to the home folder, the last folder, or the current folder, and Folder can be selected as the default tab. Its label and icon can be changed without removing or re-adding the folder. Add as many separate **Folder** tabs as you need, each with its own path, label, and icon. Use **Specific tag** for a direct shortcut to one tag or **All tags** for the grouped tag browser. Each specific-tag tab can also have its own label and icon.

## Grouped Views

The Authors, Series, and All tags tabs group your library by metadata instead of by folder. Each grouped view keeps its own display mode, sort field, and sort direction, so you can browse Authors as a list sorted A-Z while Series stays a cover grid sorted by recently read.

- **Authors** groups books by author. Independent display mode and sort/reverse.
- **Series** groups books by series, ordered by series position inside each group. Independent display mode and sort/reverse.
- **All tags** groups books by tag/keyword. Independent display mode plus a global tag sort and direction.

Adjust a grouped view's display and sort from its context menu while that tab is open. Changes are saved per view.
