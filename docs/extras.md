<!-- Documentation current through ZenOS v3.3.0. -->

## Overview

Extras contains optional tools and integrations. It covers reading statistics, plugin installation, OPDS browsing, Rakuyomi behavior, and Lockdown Mode.

## ZenPM

On supported non-Android ARM32 and ARM64 devices, choose **Zen Settings > Extras > Install ZenPM** to install the Zen plugin manager directly from ZenOS. ZenPM uses the ZenOS status bar while browsing packages.

## Stats

Open the **Stats** tab from the Navbar to view reading activity. Use **Zen Settings > Extras > Stats** to choose and arrange the dashboard widgets, enable Edit mode for on-page adjustments, set the default text size, and choose stat separators. Widgets can show activity for today, week, month, year, all time, personal records, your library, the current book, reading trends, goals, and the reading calendar.

### Widgets and settings

Choose from Today, This week, This month, This year, All time, Personal records, Library, Current book, Reading trend, Reading goals, and Reading calendar widgets. Enable the widgets you want and hold an item in **Zen Settings > Extras > Stats > Widgets** to arrange its position. The dashboard has six slots; the Reading calendar uses two.

The Reading trend widget can show pages or time for the past 7, 14, 30, or 90 days. Page totals use stable pages when a book provides them. Text-based widgets can use the default Stats font size or an individual override. **Edit mode** is enabled by default to open a widget's settings directly from the Stats page. Use **Stat separators** to choose dividers, outlines, or no separation, and set **Week reset day** to Sunday or Monday.

## OPDS

Use the switch on **Zen Settings > Extras > Zen OPDS** to apply ZenOS styling to the OPDS catalog browser. Open its submenu to choose the display mode. The OPDS view inherits the same styling as your library: rounded corners, list and mosaic view, items per page, and other layout options all carry over. Each book in the catalog shows its cover.

Tap and hold any item to open the OPDS context menu for per-item actions.

## Rakuyomi

Enable **Zen Settings > Extras > Rakuyomi > Return to chapter list on exit** to keep the current behavior: Rakuyomi-owned books return to the manga chapter list when you exit the reader.

Disable it to return to the Rakuyomi library view instead.

Enable **Exclude from Home** to keep Rakuyomi chapters out of recent Home content.

## Lockdown Mode

Use **Lockdown mode** to configure library, Controls, and reader restrictions. See [Lockdown Mode](/zen-os/docs/lockdown-mode) for details.
