<!-- Documentation current through ZenOS v3.0.0. -->

## Overview

Extras collects optional additions that fall outside of the Library/Reader. It includes Stats, ZenPM installation, Zen OPDS, TBR behavior, custom icons, Rakuyomi return behavior, lighting automation, whole-word search matching, sleep settings, and Lockdown Mode.

## ZenPM

On non-Android devices, choose **Zen Settings > Extras > Install ZenPM** to install the Zen plugin manager directly from ZenOS.

## Stats

Open the **Stats** tab from the Navbar to view reading activity. Use **Zen Settings > Extras > Stats** to choose and arrange the dashboard widgets, enable Edit mode for on-page adjustments, set the default text size, and choose stat separators. Widgets can show activity for today, week, month, year, all time, personal records, your library, the current book, reading trends, goals, and the reading calendar.

### Widgets and settings

Choose from Today, This week, This month, This year, All time, Personal records, Library, Current book, Reading trend, Reading goals, and Reading calendar widgets. Enable the widgets you want and hold an item in **Zen Settings > Extras > Stats > Widgets** to arrange its position. The dashboard has six slots; the Reading calendar uses two.

The Reading trend widget can show pages or time for the past 7, 14, 30, or 90 days. Text-based widgets can use the default Stats font size or an individual override. Enable **Edit mode** to open a widget's settings directly from the Stats page, and use **Stat separators** to choose dividers, outlines, or no separation.

## OPDS

Enable **Zen Settings > Extras > Zen OPDS** to apply ZenOS styling to the OPDS catalog browser. The OPDS view inherits the same styling as your library: rounded corners, list and mosaic view, items per page, and other layout options all carry over. Each book in the catalog shows its cover.

Tap and hold any item to open the OPDS context menu for per-item actions.

## To Be Read

To add one book to your To Be Read list, tap and hold it in the Library, choose **Read status**, then choose **To Be Read**. The book appears in the To Be Read Navbar tab and anywhere the Home Featured or unified Strip widget uses To Be Read as its source.

To include every new book automatically, enable **Zen Settings > Extras > Include new books in TBR**. This adds books with the New status to the To Be Read Navbar tab and Home widgets without changing their saved read status. New includes unread books and books modified since they were last opened.

## Custom Icons

The bundled ZenOS and KOReader icons remain the default. To use loose icon
overrides, enable **Zen Settings > Extras > Enable custom icons** and place them directly in
`/koreader/icons` as before.

For a named pack, copy its folder or ZIP into `/koreader/icons/zen`, enable
custom icons, and select it under **Zen Settings > Extras > Custom icon pack**. Valid ZIPs are
installed automatically. See [Custom Icon Packs](/zen-os/docs/icon-packs) for the complete
installation and authoring guide.

> Note: Icons placed directly inside `/koreader/plugins/zenos.koplugin/icons` are erased on updates, so do not put custom icons there.

## Rakuyomi

Enable **Zen Settings > Extras > Rakuyomi > Return to chapter list on exit** to keep the current behavior: Rakuyomi-owned books return to the manga chapter list when you exit the reader.

Disable it to return to the Rakuyomi library view instead.

## Schedules

Use **Zen Settings > Extras > Schedules** for automatic brightness, night mode, and warmth changes. Brightness and warmth can follow either a clock schedule or KOReader's light/dark mode, with separate values for each state. These two methods are mutually exclusive for each setting: enabling a schedule turns off its light/dark values, and enabling light/dark values turns off its schedule.

Lighting automation disables KOReader's Auto warmth and night mode plugin because it would compete for the same device controls. Warmth settings appear only on devices with natural-light support.

## Search, Sleep, And Lockdown

Use **Zen Settings > Extras > Search** to switch library search between substring and whole-word matching.

Use **Zen Settings > Extras > Sleep** for KOReader sleep screen controls, sleep presets, automatic dimmer, and automatic suspend integrations when available.

Use **Zen Settings > Extras > Lockdown mode** to configure library, Controls, and reader restrictions.
