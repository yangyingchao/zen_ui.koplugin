## Overview

Controls adds a fast control panel to KOReader. It allows you to toggle Wi-Fi, frontlight, rotation, ZenOS modes, brightness, and warmth controls with a single swipe. You can also add action, plugin-menu, and KOReader-menu buttons for quick access.

## Options

- Choose and arrange up to 9 visible buttons.
- Show or hide button labels.
- Configure the rotate button to cycle rotation or apply a fixed 90, 180, or 270 rotation.
- Add action buttons backed by dispatcher actions.
- Add plugin buttons from launchable plugin menus found on the device.
- Add KOReader menu buttons for native submenus available in the current library or reader context.
- Get an automatically suggested icon when creating an action, plugin, or KOReader menu button.
- Use the screenshot button with a configurable countdown timer.
- Show brightness and warmth sliders when the device supports those controls.
- Hold a slider's minus button to turn the frontlight off or set warmth to zero.
- Set an optional timeout that automatically turns Incognito Mode off.
- Flip the left-hand/right-hand icon used by Controls and the Library/Home menu tab.
- Reset the button layout to defaults without deleting saved action and plugin buttons.
