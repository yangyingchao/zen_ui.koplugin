## How do I install ZenOS?

See the [Installation](/zen-os/docs/installation) guide for full installation instructions.

## ZenOS is not starting and doesn't show in the Plugins list

Make sure you downloaded the [release](https://github.com/AnthonyGress/zen_ui.koplugin/releases) and did not leave a second folder inside `zenos.koplugin`. The installed `zenos.koplugin` folder must contain `main.lua` and the other ZenOS code files directly, not another nested `zenos.koplugin` folder.

## How do I access the reader menu?

Swipe up while in a book, then tap the **Aa** icon.

## No books found

Set the Home folder to the location where your books are, preferably a dedicated folder such as `/books`, under **Zen Settings > Library > Home folder > Set home folder**. Books must use a KOReader-supported, DRM-free format. KOReader can only read open format books and cannot read proprietary formats such `azw3`, `kfx`, `mobi` etc. You will need to convert your books to an open format to use KOReader

## Calibre loads all my books into folders of the authors, how can I fix that?

Enable the setting **Zen Settings > Library > Layout > Show all files from subfolders**.

## How do I navigate the entire filesystem?
Set **Zen Settings > Library > Home folder > Lock home folder** to **Off**.
