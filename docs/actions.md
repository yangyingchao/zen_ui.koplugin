## Overview

ZenOS registers dispatcher actions with KOReader so they can be assigned to gestures, Controls buttons, Navbar tabs, Launcher buttons, and any other KOReader feature that uses the Dispatcher action picker.

Controls, Navbar, and Launcher can also launch detected plugin menus directly. Those plugin buttons are launch shortcuts, not dispatcher actions.

## ZenOS dispatcher actions

## Trigger surfaces

| Surface | How to use actions |
| --- | --- |
| Gestures | Assign any ZenOS dispatcher action from KOReader's gesture action picker. Reader-only actions only work while a book is open. |
| Controls | Go to **Zen Settings > Controls > Buttons**, choose **Add > Action**, pick a dispatcher action, then set its icon and label. |
| Navbar | Go to **Zen Settings > Navbar > Tabs**, choose **Add > Action**, pick a dispatcher action, then set its icon and label. |
| Launcher | Go to **Zen Settings > Launcher > Buttons**, choose **Add > Action**, pick a dispatcher action, then set its icon and label. |
| KOReader Dispatcher integrations | Any KOReader or plugin UI that exposes Dispatcher actions can use the same ZenOS action IDs. |

## Plugin launch shortcuts

Controls, Navbar, and Launcher also include **Add > Plugin Menu**. This scans installed plugins for launchable menu entries and creates a shortcut to that plugin menu. Use this for plugin screens that are not exposed as dispatcher actions.
